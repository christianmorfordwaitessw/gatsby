seoTitle: Gatsby Product Updates for June 2020

In June Gatsby decided to be intentional and quieter in our social media channels to make room for conversations around systemic racism. 

During that period Gatsby [matched donations](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/donation-matching/) to organizations that specialize in criminal justice reform, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU. We also [launched Gatsby Voices](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-voices/), a content series where members of the Gatsby community can share the story of their experiences in tech. (Please apply - those who are selected will be compensated $500 USD for their work.). And we renewed our commitment to our core value of “You Belong Here”, and we’re taking internal action to expand our organizational identity, reevaluate our hiring and career advancement policies, bring in expert consultation, [and other steps](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-06-11-you-belong-here-commitment/). 

The efforts above are just the beginning of the work we’re doing to ensure Black lives matter in our world, our industry, and our company. 
## 🚀 New in Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud!

### 3 new CMS’s (plus 1)  in Gatsby Cloud 
We’ve made it easier to use [Gatsby Cloud](https://gatsbyjs.com) with three amazing CMS’s -  [Kentico Kontent](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/kentico-kontent/), [Flotiq](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/flotiq/), [AgilityCMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/agility-cms/). Gatsby Cloud also has [an improved Drupal integration](https://youtu.be/Mm6wrDr2DBE) (Check it out [here](https://www.drupal.org/project/gatsby) 🎉. 

So, which [headless CMS](/docs/glossary/headless-cms/) should you choose? Why not try all three? With Gatsby you can swap the data provider for your project and build each site with the same Gatsby account. Then you can compare the developer experience, content editing experience, and build times for each platform. 

And speaking of comparing build times…

### New Build Benchmarks in “Will It Build”

Thank you to the team at Sanity for adding their CMS to Will It Build, Gatsby benchmarking site. Sanity has one of the fastest _uncached code change_ build times of any CMS we track. But get this - in June their team also released an update to their source plugin that cut _data / content_ build times [in half](https://willit.build/details/type/blog/source/sanity/page-count/8192)!

### Configure Your Gatsby Site Without Code
Gatsby Admin launched an alpha! This early release includes plugin and theme management, as well as a theme file shadowing interface. [Register here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/admin-alpha/) to try out Gatsby Admin for your own project.

### Partner with Gatsby

If you have an agency that wants to specialize on Gatsby, or you are building tools for the Gatsby ecosystem, then we now have [an official way to work with you](/blog/2020-06-22-Announcing-Gatsby-Partner-Program/)! Partners will be able to beta test new products, access training and sales materials, and will have a direct connection to the Gatsby team.
